				<p>
					Rackham was born in Harrison, Michigan. He graduated from high school in Leslie, Michigan in 1878. In 1879, he moved to Detroit, Michigan to work for Berry Brothers. In 1884, he began studying law under the employ of Adolph Sloman, and was admitted to the Bar in 1885. The next year, he married Mary A. Horton of Fenton, Michigan.

					In 1894, he partnered with John W. Anderson to open a law firm. The partnership was very successful, counting among their clients Alexander Y. Malcomson, a Detroit coal dealer. In 1903, at Malcomson's advice, Henry Ford hired Rackham and Anderson to draw up papers incorporating the Ford Motor Company. Ford (and Malcomson) also convinced the partners to buy stock in the company. Rackham scraped together $5,000 by borrowing some money and selling some real estate parcels.With great uncertainty, and against the advice of others, (the president of the Michigan Savings Bank infamously told Rackham "The horse is here to stay, but the automobile is only a novelty – a fad,") Rackham bought 50 shares of Ford stock (from a total of 890 shares); Anderson bought another 50. In addition to Ford, Anderson, and Rackham, seven other people were awarded stock in the company, including Malcomson, James J. Couzens (future mayor of Detroit and Michigan Senator) and John Francis Dodge and Horace Elgin Dodge (who later founded the Dodge Brothers Motor Vehicle Company).At the first meeting of stockholders, Rackham was elected chairman.
